### Typescript Client

The typescript client is available to use and is fully operational, however there are some known issues that we're working to resolve. Note that they do not have any effect on how the client works.

`npm -i symxify-client`

### C# Client

The C# client is completed, but not 100% tested. Feel free to try it out on Nuget!

dotnet add package Symxify.Client

### Other Clients

Feel free to fork and add your own clients!
